# CourseProject for CS410 at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign

## The python implementation is following the instructions from research papers:

"Latent Aspect Rating Analysis on Review Text Data: A Rating Regression Approach", 
http://sifaka.cs.uiuc.edu/~wang296/paper/rp166f-wang.pdf

"Latent Aspect Rating Analysis without Aspect Keyword Supervision",
http://sifaka.cs.uiuc.edu/~wang296/paper/p618.pdf

## Implementations and Contributers:

This implementation uses the orignal implementation given by the author (http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~hw5x/Codes/LARA.zip).
Also, the Latent Rating Regression model and Bootstrap use the implementation of existing models from:

## Organization of the implemenataion:

Directory:

There are two classes Sentence and Review each coded in different python files. These act as data containers for a sentence and a single review respectively. 
ReadData contains all functions for processing the reviews. BootStrap class contains the bootstrapping algorithm as explained in the paper. LRR class contains the implementation of Rating Regression algorithm as described in the paper. 
We had initially coded as ipython notebooks so .ipynb files also exist.
* hotelReviews directory is where the review files go (json encoded) - both Training and Testing data
* settings directory contains the configuration files for the model
* modelData will contain the files generated by the model

How to run:
Have nltk and scipy installed. Also download modules for nltk-stopwords and porter-stemmer. 

For preprocessing reviews:
python3 BootStrap.py

For running the main model:
python3 LRR.py
